description: A poem.
---

It is just standing there, knowing nothing of my presence, <br> As I stare from behind the curtains. The sun has barely swept
<br> 
The tops of surrounding trees and the frost is still clinging <br> To the grass, unwilling to accept defeat. This doe knows
<br> 
Nothing of my presence even though it fears it much. So bravely <br> It pushes further into dangerous realms, looking for something
<br> 
I might never see. Does it feel a rush while it eats in the face of <br> Danger? Is an adrenaline fix why it avoids the safe depths of the
<br> 
Unsuspecting trees or grassy fields in the distance? When it is done <br> Here, will it dash into the distance just to stop and breathe in
<br> 
Victoriously? Are these small triumphs what keeps the herds <br> Going, as their woods are being snatched, one at a time?
<br> 
My neighbor opened the door and the doe sprinted for the woods, <br> Stopping just to bestow one more look upon our dreary eyes. 
<br>
