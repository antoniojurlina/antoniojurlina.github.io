### **Work Experience**
##### Graduate Researcher / Data Scientist
*University of Maine / Orono, ME*

  * Forecasted future membership levels of food cooperatives by building and training an agent-based model parametrized according to their purchase data.
  * Forecasted future membership levels of food cooperatives by building an automated time series script that estimates optimally lagged and differentiated ARIMA processes for each group, trains them on the purchase data and forecasts one year ahead.
  * Built a shiny [dashboard](https://ant-onio.shinyapps.io/food_club_abm/) so other team members can quickly and efficiently explore the outputs of the agent-based model.
  * Completed research projects and successfully communicated the results with graphic tools and in oral and written form (including policy reports).
  * Created a single, reusable data set by joining, pivoting and cleaning multiple tables with
 hundreds of millions of rows of data, and organized it according to standard tidy principles.
  * Co-authored a published [book review](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.26613/esic.4.1.182).

##### Undergraduate Researcher / Data Analyst
*University of Maine / Orono, ME*

  * Created and enumerated surveys, performed sentiment analysis on interview responses
  and created individualized reports.
  * Wrote API access scripts that enable a wide research team access to government data websites, and built a dashboard visualizing specific differences in variables reported across government agencies.
  * Wrote data reports that summarize the temporal and spatial scope of data sources of interest, as well as listing all the unique variables and methodology behind obtaining them.
<br> 

##### Projects
  * Analyzed the impact of COVID19 closures on Gasoline Tax revenue for the State of
  Maine by building a time series model forecasting expected trends in traffic and in revenue and estimating the relationship between traffic and gasoline tax revenue using weighted least squares regression. 
  * Predicted highest Taxi Cab revenue locations across Manhattan by building and training a Random Forest model and comparing it with the predictions from a generalized additive model and a krigging model that estimates spatial autocorrelation through variograms and predicts locations with highest expected fares.
  * Found optimal model outputs through grid-based and gradient-based searches in multidimensional outputs using MATLAB and Stata (mostly on estimates from maximum likelihood models, as well as regression approaches tailored to discrete data, limited dependent variables, and fractional data).
  * Built a [Shiny app](https://ant-onio.shinyapps.io/Enneagram/) that administers a psychometric personality test using official methodology and displays results for the user.
  * Built a [Shiny app](https://ant-onio.shinyapps.io/omitted_variable_bias/) to allow users to explore the theoretical implications of omitting a relevant variable in a least squares regression model.
  * Estimated the impact of economic freedom on GDP growth by deconstructing an economic freedom index and using it in a fixed effects country level least squares model.
